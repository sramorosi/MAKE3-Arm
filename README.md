This project is intended as a high school robotics level teaching tool to describe how to design, build and analyze a robot arm.  Some objectives are to teach things such as:
1. Inverse Kinematics (getting servo angles from a desired point)
2. Controlling multiple servos (multiple synchronized servos)
3. Principles of Statics (forces and torques/moments)
4. Mechanical design of servo joints that provides strength and control (robust)
