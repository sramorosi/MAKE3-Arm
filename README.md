# MAKE3-Arm

This repository contains the complete design files for the MAKE3 Robot Arm and input-control arm, and the code to control the arm.

The design files are in the folder **OpenSCAD-code**, and are written in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). They are customizable. More info. in folder.

The control code files are in the folder **MAKE3**.  and are written in [Arduino C](https://www.arduino.cc/). More info. in folder.
 
This project is intended as a low cost teaching tool to describe how to design, build and analyze a robot arm.  Some objectives are to teach things such as:
1. Inverse Kinematics (getting servo angles from a desired point)
2. Controlling multiple servos (multiple synchronized servos)
3. Principles of Statics (forces and torques/moments)
4. Mechanical design of servo joints that provides strength and control (robust)
